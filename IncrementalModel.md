The term "incremental methodology" describes the process of developing a product piece by piece. Usually, these increases are complimentary to one another. The product is finished when all of the increments are finished.
It resembles building a house from the ground up. First, we build the Foundation level. Next came ground floor, the first floor, second floor, and so on.

The following explanations are given by this approach's salient features:

Risk Mitigation for Customers 

The software is built in increments, thereby reducing the overall risk. In a sequential approach (Iterative), the customers get to test the software only at the end of all the phases. For large projects, the waiting time can be 9-12 months or even more. 
Building a product/software in 9-12 months and finding out that it does not meet expectations is a big risk for customers. Using a phased approach, we minimize risk as each addition is possible within 2-3 months.

Improved Customer Collaboration 

Short increment cycles improve customer engagement with development. This is a significant improvement over the sequential approach. 
This is good for the development team and allows us to understand the expectations of the customers quite regularly..

Here are some examples of software projects that might use the Incremental Model:

Mobile Apps: Many mobile app development projects utilize the incremental model. Developers may release versions of the app with basic features first, then gradually add more features and enhancements in subsequent updates. For instance, social media apps like Facebook or Instagram often introduce new features incrementally over time.

Web Development: Websites are often developed incrementally, especially in agile environments. 
Developers may release a basic version of the website first, then iterate on it by adding new features or improving existing ones based on user feedback. Content management systems like WordPress or Joomla also evolve incrementally with regular updates.

Video Games: Game development often follows an incremental model, especially for large-scale projects. Developers may release playable demos or early access versions of the game to gather feedback from players and make iterative improvements before the final release. Games like Minecraft or Factorio have evolved significantly over time through incremental updates.

Enterprise Software: Complex enterprise software solutions are often developed incrementally. Companies may release a basic version of the software to a limited group of users, such as employees or beta testers, and then gradually add more functionality based on user feedback and business requirements.
Operating Systems: Operating systems like Windows or macOS undergo continuous development and improvement through incremental updates. These updates may include bug fixes, security patches, and new features introduced gradually over time.

E-commerce Platforms: Platforms like Shopify or Magento often release updates incrementally to improve user experience, add new features, or enhance security. These updates may be rolled out gradually to users to minimize disruption to operations.

Healthcare Systems: Healthcare software solutions, such as electronic medical record (EMR) systems or telemedicine platforms, may be developed incrementally to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to meet the evolving needs of healthcare providers and patients.
